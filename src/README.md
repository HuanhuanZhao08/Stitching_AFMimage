### Usage
There are two jupyter notebook files in the **src** folder, [AFM_image_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/src/AFM_image_preprocessing.ipynb) is used to generate flattened topographical images, amplitude images, and differential images. [AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/src/AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb) is used to stitch the images together. To test the code with the AFM images used in the paper, the user needs to:
- Step 1: Install environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  [requirements.txt](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/requirements.txt) contains the necessary libraries for executing the notebook.
- Step 2: Download the datasets from the **Data** folder [here](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/tree/main/data) and unpack it within the same folder as [AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/src/AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb). 
- Step 3: Run the [AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/src/AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb) notebook. 
- If you are using your own data, you can either preprocess it using [AFM_image_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/src/AFM_image_preprocessing.ipynb) or prepare the flattened images and second channel images by yourself. Remember to change the input path to your own data path when running [AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb](https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/Stitching_AFMimage/blob/main/src/AFM_stitching_V2.ipynb).# Project Code
